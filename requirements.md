# Glen Rock Historical and Preservation Society (GRHPS)

The Glen Rock Historical & Preservation Society (GRHPS) was incorporated in 1992 as a registered 501(A)3 non-profit organization. Our mission is to heighten the public's awareness of, and appreciation for, the history, growth, and development of Glen Rock, New Jersey. We fulfill our mission in many ways; we will use this website to share all that we do - and hope to do - with you.

## The Museum at the Station
 
As part of our community outreach, we maintain and organize The Museum at the Station, located inside the Main Line Train Station.  Here we showcase items from Glen Rock's past, with displays that change periodically as well as permanent exhibits featuring the Erie Railroad and artifacts from Glen Rock's farming history. The Museum at the Station is open to the public on the LAST SUNDAY of each month from 1 to 3 pm. There is no admission fee although donations are gratefully accepted in Ye Olde Tip Jar.  Exhibitions are appropriate for all ages.
