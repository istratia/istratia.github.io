# markdown
## apparently theres a thing called markdown
markdown is supposedly supposed to make things headings and subheadings if you do a certain amount of hashtags i think but the last time i did it it wasnt working so idk if it'll work but it looks like its working so hopefully it is
also:
* asterisks
* create
* lists :0
* **asterisks also make things bold**
* *and italic*
* also you can link a url but i dont have a url to link so yeah
* i dont know how to make something a new line without making a new list thingy though...
